# Social-Network-API

## Description
Created a social media back-end application that allows for users to sign up with a username and email address, update their information, and delete the user as well. Also aple to post
or "post and or creaste" thoughts that others will be able to see and react on. Users are able to react on thoughts made and users can see amount of reactions made 
per post. Users are also able to add other users to be their friends as well, which can be seen by the unique id and by the friend counter that can be seen in insomnia.
All that is needed to be done now, is to have the front end applicatoin ready to go, and we should have a great beta website for users to post thoughts, reactions, and 
add friends

Users of this application will have to install express and mongoose.
